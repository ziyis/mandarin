For agents, you want to use Scripts/Agent/AgentFSM and drag that onto whatever agent you want.

Add the WatsonListener Prefab to the scene and assign the values. Agent_One/Agent_Two are both examples of agents.

I believe the rest is self-explanatory, but if they're not send me a message on Slack "Christopher Chen".

You should only need all the scripts in Assets/Scripts/Agent, except for Agent_Test.(Although that should be an example of an agent script's functions.)

An example of the agents working is in AgentDev.unity.
